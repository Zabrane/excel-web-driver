Automate web browser actions with an easy Excel interface.

So far it lets you:
- navigate to URLs
- click on elements with IDs
- change the value of form elements with IDs
- print the page to PDF (Windows 10 only for now).

Although you can turn off showing Internet Explorer... don't touch the computer while the steps are running. Unfortunately some of the code uses SendKeys and I haven't found a workaround yet.
